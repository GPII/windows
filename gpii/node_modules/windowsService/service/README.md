# GPII Windows Service

A Windows Service that starts the GPII process (and others in [service-config.json](service-config.json)) when the user logs on, restarts it when it stops unexpectedly, and provides the ability to run high-privileged tasks. 


## Operation

### Install the service
```
node index.js --install

    --programArgs=ARGS  Arguments for the service application, in addition to --service.
```

### Uninstall the service:
```
node index.js --uninstall
```

### Starting the service
```
net start gpii-service
```

### Running the service (as invoked by windows):
```
node index.js --service
```

## Notes

### Windows Service

The work to make it run as a Windows Service is provided by [stegru/node-os-service#GPII-2338](https://github.com/stegru/node-os-service/tree/GPII-2338). This is a fork of [node-os-service](https://github.com/stephenwvickers/node-os-service) to make it detect user logins.
