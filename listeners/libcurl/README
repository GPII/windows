The curl include files and libs
 
+ Building libcurl for the GPII Windows Listeners

While http://curl.haxx.se/download.html list binaries for win32 these are usually out of date so is best to build from source
 
The include\libcurl\*.h files here have been copied from the curl distribution include/ 
The \lib\libcurl libs are built as follows. We build the static version to minimise dependency problems

+ Building with VisualStudio

As we are now build using VisualStudio we need the VS build of libcurl
See the instructions in <curl>\winbuild\BUILD.WINDOWS.txt (known to work with VS Express 2013)

For a minimum version run this command in the visual studio command prompt
  nmake /f Makefile.vc mode=static ENABLE_SSPI=no ENABLE_IPV6=no ENABLE_IDN=no ENABLE_WINSSL=no
Run again with DEBUG=yes and copy the 2 libraries

+ Building  with MinGW

These instructions are an alternative if it is required to build the listeners with MinGWN (using build.sh) 
Whilst a Microsoft Visual Studio build is provided with curl there are problems
linking it from a MinGW build as used in the listeners

Note that whilst the easy way to build libcurl with mingw is
  mingw32-make mingw32
this includes ldap and other extra dependencies. 

The following procedure uses the usual configure/make process but requires msys
make to also be installed. The easiest way is to install msys-base, even if
Git for Windows is already installed.

* Grab curl source
* Install minimal mingw packages of 
	mingw32-base
	ming32-gcc-g++
	msys-base (for make) 
* open msys shell (eg C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\msys.bat)
* cd to curl source (eg /c/Users/<user>/projects/curl-7.37.0)
* run ./configure --disable-shared --disable-ldap --without-zlib --without-libsh2
* run make
* copy .../libcurl/lib/.libs/libcurl.a to here
* copy .../libcurl/inc/libcurl to here
