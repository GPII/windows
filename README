# GPII for Windows

Contains platform-specific components of the GPII architecture for Windows. See http://gpii.net/ for overall details of the GPII
project. After checkout out using git, this project will require node.js and npm to be installed - please consult
http://wiki.gpii.net/index.php/Core_(real-time)_Framework_v0.1_-_Installation_Instructions for installation instructions.

After this project is checked out and its prerequisites installed, a run of the Windows batch file "build.cmd" will check out 
GPII's universal project https://github.com/GPII/universal in a subdirectory. After this process has concluded without error, 
you can run the GPII personalisation system on Windows by executing start.cmd.



Note that tests and function involving the High Contrast setting will fail on all current versions of Windows (including 
Windows 7 SP1 and Windows 8 SP2) unless the following hotfix from Microsoft is applied: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2516889

See http://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-49 for more details of this issue. 

# Upcoming Grunt Support

We are in the process of adding support for building and running utility tasks 
with grunt.js. At some point these will replace the current build scripts.

To use these, you must be running a recent version of npm, preferably greater 
than 1.4.  If you need to upgrade npm you can issue the following command:

	npm install -g npm

To build the GPII for Windows using grunt, perform the following:

	git clone https://github.com/GPII/windows.git
	cd windows
	npm install --ignore-scripts=true
	grunt build
