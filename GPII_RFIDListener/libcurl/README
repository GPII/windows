The .h files here have been copied from the curl distribution include/ 
The libcurl.a is built as follows

+ Building libcurl for the GPII Windows Listeners

Whilst a Microsoft Visual Studio build is provided with curl there are problems
linking it from a MinGW build as used in the listeners

Note that whilst the easy way to build libcurl with mingw is
  mingw32-make mingw32
this includes ldap and other extra dependencies. 

The following procedure uses the usual configure/make process but requires msys
make to also be installed. The easiest way is to install msys-base, even if
Git for Windows is already installed.

* Grab curl source
* Install minimal mingw packages of 
	mingw32-base
	ming32-gcc-g++
	msys-base (for make) 
* open msys shell (eg C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\msys.bat)
* cd to curl source (eg /c/Users/<user>/projects/curl-7.37.0)
* run ./configure --disable-shared --disable-ldap --without-zlib --without-libsh2
* run make
* copy .../libcurl/lib/.libs/libcurl.a to here
* copy .../libcurl/inc/libcurl to here
