  The support for specifying the retries and the retry delay when using
  Invoke-WebRequest has been added recently and is available since the 6.1.x series.
  See https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/tag/v6.1.0-preview.4

  After our vm receives such update, we will be able to pass -MaximumRetryCount and
  -RetryIntervalSec as parameters when calling Invoke-WebRequest.
