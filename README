Contains platform-specific components of the GPII architecture for Windows. See http://gpii.net/ for overall details of the GPII
project. After checkout out using git, this project will require node.js and npm to be installed - please consult
http://wiki.gpii.net/index.php/Core_(real-time)_Framework_v0.1_-_Installation_Instructions for installation instructions.

After this project is checked out and its prerequisites installed, a run of the Windows batch file "build.cmd" will check out 
GPII's universal project https://github.com/GPII/universal in a subdirectory. After this process has concluded without error, 
you can run the GPII personalisation system on Windows by executing start.cmd.



Note that tests and function involving the High Contrast setting will fail on all current versions of Windows (including 
Windows 7 SP1 and Windows 8 SP2) unless the following hotfix from Microsoft is applied: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2516889

See http://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-49 for more details of this issue.
